# MSE-CapsPPISP: Spatial Hierarchical Protein-Protein Interaction Sites Prediction Using Squeeze-and-Excitation Capsule Networks
## Feature extraction
1. The Position-Specific-Scoring-Matrix (PSSM) feature can be obtained by using the PSI-BLAST [21] programs from NCBI' website or from other studies.
 
2. The predicted secondary structure and predicted solvent accessibility features are derived from https://services.healthtech.dtu.dk/service.php?NetSurfP-2.0.

3. The physicochemical characteristics are derived from Zhang *et al* [28].
